# Contributing

### First off, thank you for considering contributing to cryptowatch :tada:

#### Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a question, search the <a href="https://github.com/alexanderepstein/cryptowatch/issues">issue tracker</a> to see if someone else in the community has already created a ticket. If not, go ahead and <a href="https://github.com/alexanderepstein/cryptowatch/issues/new">make one</a>!

#### Otherwise if implementing a fix, feature or new component go through these steps

#### 1. Fork & Clone The Repository
* Fork the repository
* To download the full source code after forking
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusernamehere/cryptowatch
```

#### 2. Get all the Dependencies and enter the virtual enviornment
* Make sure you have pipenv installed
* Then cd into the cryptowatch folder ```cd cryptowatch```
* Run ```pipenv install```
* Run ```pipenv shell```

#### 3. Implement your fix, feature or enhancement

At this point, you're ready to make your changes!

Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:
Make sure to make your commit messages informative and concise.


#### 4. Check The Script Runtime

Try running all possible configurations for cryptowatch that you changed. (Sorry there are no tests currently).
Basically don't just code without trying to run it afterwards.

#### 5. Create A Pull Request

First make sure to commit and push your changes to your forked repository.
Check to see if there are any conflicts with the main repository and your fork.
If there are none submit the request and give details as to what you changed or added.

#### 7. Bask In All The Glory Of Adding To A FOSS Application
